## Notes

- ~~This UDF currently works **only** with the **INSTALLED** version of LibreOffice. The **Portable** version will **Not work**.~~
- The ability to Automate LibreOffice Portable (and OpenOffice) has been added, and *Should* work correctly. It currently adds some temporary Registry entries however. See `_LO_InitializePortable`. 
- For those using AutoIt versions **older** than ***3.3.16.1,*** one internal function used for “Saving as” and “Exporting” documents uses Maps, which will **Not** be recognized as proper syntax in AutoIt. In Calc, all Fields related functions use Maps.
- LibreOffice uses Micrometers for sizing internally, all functions in this UDF, unless otherwise stated, use Micrometers. A converter has been created for converting to/from Inches, Centimeters, Printer’s Points, and Millimeters to/from Micrometers, for all sizing needs. _ConvertFromMicrometer, and _ConvertToMicrometer. Either for Writer (LOWriter) or Calc (LOCalc).
- LibreOffice uses the Long color format for all color settings, A converter has also been created for converting from/to Hex; (R)ed, (G)reen, (Blue); (H)ue, (S)aturation, and (B)rightness; and (C)yan, (M)agenta, (Y)ellow, Blac(K); to/from long color format. _ConvertColorFromLong, and _ConvertColorToLong. Either for Writer (LOWriter) or Calc (LOCalc).
